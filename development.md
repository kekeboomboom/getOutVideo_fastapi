# FastAPI Project - Development

## Docker Compose

* Start the local stack with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose watch
```

* Now you can open your browser and interact with these URLs:

Backend, JSON based web API based on OpenAPI: <http://localhost:8000>

Automatic interactive documentation with Swagger UI (from the OpenAPI backend): <http://localhost:8000/docs>

Adminer, database web administration: <http://localhost:8080>

**Note**: The first time you start your stack, it might take a minute for it to be ready. While the backend waits for the database to be ready and configures everything. You can check the logs to monitor it.

To check the logs, run (in another terminal):

```bash 
docker compose logs
```

To check the logs of a specific service, add the name of the service, e.g.:

```bash
docker compose logs backend
```

## Local Development

The Docker Compose files are configured so that each of the services is available in a different port in `localhost`.

For the backend, it uses the same port that would be used by its local development server, so the backend is at `http://localhost:8000`.

This way, you could turn off a Docker Compose service and start its local development service, and everything would keep working, because it all uses the same port.

For example, you could stop the `backend` Docker Compose service:

```bash
docker compose stop backend
```

And then you can run the local development server for the backend:

```bash
cd backend
fastapi dev app/main.py
```

## Docker Compose files and env vars

There is a main `compose.yml` file with all the configurations that apply to the whole stack, it is used automatically by `docker compose`.

And there's also a `compose.override.yml` with overrides for development, for example to mount the source code as a volume. It is used automatically by `docker compose` to apply overrides on top of `compose.yml`.

These Docker Compose files use the `.env` file containing configurations to be injected as environment variables in the containers.

They also use some additional configurations taken from environment variables set in the scripts before calling the `docker compose` command.

After changing variables, make sure you restart the stack:

```bash
docker compose watch
```

## The .env file

The `.env` file is the one that contains all your configurations, generated keys and passwords, etc.

Depending on your workflow, you could want to exclude it from Git, for example if your project is public. In that case, you would have to make sure to set up a way for your CI tools to obtain it while building or deploying your project.

One way to do it could be to add each environment variable to your CI/CD system, and updating the `compose.yml` file to read that specific env var instead of reading the `.env` file.

## Pre-commits and code linting

we are using a tool called [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/) (modern alternative to [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)) for code linting and formatting.

When you install it, it runs right before making a commit in git. This way it ensures that the code is consistent and formatted even before it is committed.

You can find a file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with configurations at the root of the project.

#### Install prek to run automatically

`prek` is already part of the dependencies of the project.

After having the `prek` tool installed and available, you need to "install" it in the local repository, so that it runs automatically before each commit.

Using `uv`, you could do it with (make sure you are inside `backend` folder):

```bash
❯ uv run prek install -f
prek installed at `../.git/hooks/pre-commit`
```

The `-f` flag forces the installation, in case there was already a `pre-commit` hook previously installed.

Now whenever you try to commit, e.g. with:

```bash
git commit
```

...prek will run and check and format the code you are about to commit, and will ask you to add that code (stage it) with git again before committing.

Then you can `git add` the modified/fixed files again and now you can commit.

#### Running prek hooks manually

you can also run `prek` manually on all the files, you can do it using `uv` with:

```bash
❯ uv run prek run --all-files
check for added large files..............................................Passed
check toml...............................................................Passed
check yaml...............................................................Passed
fix end of files.........................................................Passed
trim trailing whitespace.................................................Passed
ruff.....................................................................Passed
ruff-format..............................................................Passed
biome check..............................................................Passed
```

## URLs

The production or staging URLs would use these same paths, but with your own domain.

### Development URLs

Development URLs, for local development.

Backend: <http://localhost:8000>

Automatic Interactive Docs (Swagger UI): <http://localhost:8000/docs>

Automatic Alternative Docs (ReDoc): <http://localhost:8000/redoc>

Adminer: <http://localhost:8080>
